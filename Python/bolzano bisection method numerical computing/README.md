# Bisection-Bolzano-Method-Numerical-Computing-
This python program is created for solving Bisection or Bolzano Method for finding the root of the linear system of equations. 


Input: A function of x, for example x3 - x2 + 2.     
       And two values: a = -200 and b = 300 such that
       f(a)*f(b) < 0, i.e., f(a) and f(b) have
       opposite signs.
Output: The value of root is : -1.0025
        OR any other value with allowed
        deviation from root.
